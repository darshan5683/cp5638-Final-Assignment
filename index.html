                    General information about Townsville is available <a href="http://www.townsville.qld.gov.au/townsville/infocentre/Pages/default.aspx">Here</a>

                    <br /><br />
                    Townsville has a population of about 200,000 and is growing at about 1 suburb per year, so there is a lot of musical activity. All private schools and most government schools have music teachers. The larger private schools are Townsville Grammar, the Cathedral School and Ryan Catholic College. The larger public high schools are Kirwan and Pimlico.
                    <br /><br />
                    Music Teachers Association of Qld is a good source of information for local music teachers.<br />
                    The Townsville Branch contact is the Secretary (Ms Margery Jorgensen)<br />
                    Phone (07) 47790382<br />
                    Email: mjo11750@bigpond.net.au<br />

                <h4>Volunteers required!</h4>
                <p>To promote live performances, we must keep production costs to a minimum. 
                    The Townsville City Council assists us by allowing many tasks to be done by volunteers. 
                    Most volunteer activities do not require any special skills e.g. setting out or stacking chairs. 
                    <br />
                    Ushers play a special role, taking tickets at the door and ensuring the comfort and safety of all patrons. 
                    A brief, free training session is compulsory for this role, to learn theatre policy, emergency evacuation procedures, etc. 
                    Ushers are then registered with Civic Theatre management and may work at many theatre performances throughout the year. </p><br /><br/>
                <p>We have performance opportunities available throughout 2018 for local musicians and organisations.</p>
